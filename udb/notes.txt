Overview

- Overview of UndoDB and LiveRecorder and how I integrated it into the shell for these tests
- Mention overhead of running with/without the recorder for this test run. 

Debugging a Build Failure

- BF-15552 seemed a good case study for using LiveRecorder to debug a BF. Using a simplified version 
of the original rollback fuzzer failure for demonstration purposes. Assuming that in production
we would have recorded the original failure and been able to debug it using the recorder.
- We can run the test under LiveRecorder and see the 2 recordings it produces.
